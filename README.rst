Blackfire Player
================

Blackfire Player is a powerful Web Crawling, Web Testing, and Web Scraper
application. It provides a nice DSL to **crawl HTTP services**, **assert
responses**, and **extract data** from HTML/XML/JSON responses.

Some Blackfire Player use cases:

* Crawl a website/API and check expectations -- aka Acceptance Tests;

* Scrape a website/API and extract values;

* Monitor a website;

* Test code with unit test integration (PHPUnit, Behat, Codeception, ...);

* Test code behavior from the outside thanks to the native Blackfire Profiler
  integration -- aka *Unit Tests from the HTTP layer* (tm).
